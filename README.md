# A/B Testing - Hypothesis
# Student Performance Analysis

Welcome to the Student Performance Analysis project repository! This project focuses on exploring student performance data through data analytics techniques and hypothesis testing. The analysis provides valuable insights into various factors influencing student success, such as gender, parental education, lunch programs, and test preparation courses.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

- Explore and visualize the dataset to understand the distribution and characteristics of student performance metrics.
- Perform hypothesis testing to assess the significance of various factors on student outcomes.
- Analyze the relationships between different variables and identify key patterns or trends.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files:

- `stud.csv`: containing the dataset used for analysis.
- `Hypothesis testing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis and hypothesis testing.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the analysis.

## Requirements
